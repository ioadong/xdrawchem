To install XDrawChem:

1) Install recent Qt and OpenBabel from packages or source.
If installing from packages, please also install the "devel" packages as well, e.g. qt5-qtbase-devel and openbabel-devel.
XDrawChem is built with Qt 5.6 and OpenBabel 2.2.3
Please file an issue on GitHub if these versions or newer fail.

2) Type "qmake".
   This will generate the XDrawChem Makefiles.

   Then type "make", followed by (as root) "make install" to build and install.

After installation:
3) Type "xdrawchem" to run the program.  Also, you may wish to type
   "xdrawchem --help", as XDrawChem supports some command line functions.

4) Setting the environment variable XDC_SERVER will override the XDC_SERVER
   set in the Makefile.

Enjoy!
